## What is deep learning 

Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. ... Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.

## What is Open CV 

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

## What is Nvidia caffe

NVIDIA Caffe, also known as NVCaffe, is an NVIDIA-maintained fork of BVLC Caffe tuned for NVIDIA GPUs, particularly in multi-GPU configurations. It includes multi-precision support as well as other NVIDIA-enhanced features and offers performance specially tuned for the NVIDIA DGX-2, DGX-1, and DGX Station.
